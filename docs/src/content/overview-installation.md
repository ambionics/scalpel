4.  Once Scalpel is properly initialized, you should get the following.
    {{< figure src="/screenshots/init.png" >}}

5.  If the installation was successful, a `Scalpel` tab should show in the Request/Response editor as follows:
    {{< figure src="/screenshots/tabs.png" >}}

6.  And also a `Scalpel` tab for configuration to install additional packages via terminal.
